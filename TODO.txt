TODO

- incorporate Salvus_1 and Salvus_2 models
- update code moved from the old csemlib/scripts into /scripts
- check if GridData parameter 'solver' is really needed
- in GridData rename the *salvus* functions as they are not specific to Salvus
- write output in the IRIS Earth model format


DONE

- rename /examples to /scripts and move code from /csemlib/scripts to that directory
- move /regional_models into /data and rename to /refinements
- subdivide /data into /base_model and /refinements
- make a single evaluate_csem.py to be used by all other functions that evaluate the CSEM


QUESTIONS

- what is the salvus_mesher_model_file?
- do we actually do anythin with topography? files needed?
- what is coastlines_detailed.vtp doing there?
